# **App Name**: Harvest Clicker

## Core Features:

- Crop Planting & Display: Display a variety of crops (initially 3-5 to start) with different grow times represented by progress bars. Allow users to 'plant' a crop by clicking on it, initiating the growth timer.
- Growth Visualization: Visualize crop growth using animated progress bars.  Notify the user with a clear visual cue when a crop is ready for harvest.
- Harvest Mechanic: Implement a harvest mechanic where users click on a fully grown crop to harvest it. Add the harvested crop to the player's inventory.
- Basic Shop: Create a simple shop where players can 'sell' harvested crops for currency. Currency is automatically added to a player's balance. No persistence is used for this MVP.
- Inventory & Currency Display: Provide clear UI elements to display the player's inventory (number of each crop type) and currency balance.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a color palette of earthy tones (greens, browns, tans) to represent the farming theme.
- Accent: Sunflower yellow (#FFDA63) for highlights and interactive elements.
- Clean, readable fonts for UI text (e.g., Open Sans).
- Simple, vector-based icons to represent different crops and resources.
- Grid-based layout for planting area and clear separation of UI elements (inventory, shop).
- Subtle animations for harvesting and crop growth.
